# Geb!
GEB (short for _Generative Event Bus_) is an event bus leveraging annotation processing to achieve maximum possible speed.

GEB is just a basic event bus in itself; the actual magician is the [processor](https://github.com/zaaarf/geb-processor).

## What's with the name?
"GEB Bus" kind of sounds like "Jeb Bush" and I think it's very funny. Please clap.
